# Quick Start

If you want to try 5ay.it comment system on your website, you only need to copy and paste `<script src="//5ay.it/now_1.js"></script>` in your `<body>` tag, where you want to place the comment component, without any registration procedure at all.

```
... <body>

<script src="//5ay.it/now_1.js"></script>

</body> ...
```

But, if you want to config and manage more detail behaviors of the comment component, please refer <a href="/v_1_en/installation">Installation</a> page of this document.
Also, if you want to use 3rd-party plug-ins for your Wordpress (or any else) website, please refer <a href="/v_1_en/plug-in">Plug-in</a> page of this document.
